# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer... 
GOOD DATA VISUALIZATION


“Napoleon’s March to Moscow” by Charles Joseph Minard (1869)

Minard’s visualization of the French invasion of Russia is considered one of the best examples of data visualization. It clearly shows six different types of information in one image: the size of the army, its location, the direction of movement, temperature, time, and distance. Even though it presents a lot of data, it remains easy to understand.

One reason this visualization works so well is its clarity. The width of the line represents the number of soldiers. As the army moves forward and then retreats, the line becomes thinner, making the heavy losses immediately noticeable. Instead of reading numbers in a table, viewers can quickly see how dramatically the army shrank.

Another strength is the effective use of visual features. The lighter color shows the army advancing, while the darker color shows the retreat. The thickness of the line also changes to represent troop size. These visual cues help viewers understand the information quickly, without needing long explanations.

The graphic also provides important context. During the retreat, a temperature chart is included at the bottom, aligned with dates. This shows how extremely cold weather affected the soldiers. By placing temperature and troop losses together, the visualization helps viewers understand the connection between freezing conditions and the army’s decline.

Overall, this visualization is successful because it presents complex information in a clear, simple, and meaningful way.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer... 

The visualization could be improved for modern audiences by:

Adding clearer labeling for viewers unfamiliar with 19th-century cartography.
Improving contrast and readability for accessibility (e.g., color-blind friendly design).
Including a brief legend explaining variables more explicitly.
However, even by modern standards, it remains exceptionally effective.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)


BAD DATA VISUALIZATION 

3D Pie Charts Used in Business Presentations (Common in tools like older versions of Microsoft Excel)

3D pie charts are often criticized because they make data harder to understand instead of clearer.

First, they can distort what we see. Because the chart is shown in 3D, the slices at the front look bigger than the ones at the back, even if they represent smaller values. This can mislead viewers and create a false impression. Research by William S. Cleveland and Robert McGill shows that people compare lengths more accurately than angles or areas. Since pie charts depend on comparing angles—and 3D effects make that even harder—they reduce accuracy.

Second, 3D pie charts reduce clarity. The extra depth, shadows, and shading do not add any useful information. Instead, they create unnecessary decoration, often called “chart junk,” a term made popular by Edward Tufte. These visual effects distract from the actual message of the data.

Third, labels can become difficult to read. Small slices are especially hard to label clearly. Sometimes the labels overlap or are placed outside the chart with lines pointing to slices, which makes the chart look crowded and confusing. This increases the mental effort required to understand the information.

Finally, pie charts are not good when there are many categories or when exact comparisons are important. In most cases, a simple bar chart would make differences between values clearer and easier to compare. 




The visualization could be improved by:

Removing 3D effects entirely.
Replacing the pie chart with a sorted bar chart, which allows viewers to compare lengths more accurately.
Using consistent, minimal color schemes.
Including data labels directly on bars for clarity.
Highlighting key categories rather than using decorative gradients.
In summary, 3D pie charts fail because they prioritize aesthetic appeal over accuracy and clarity. Replacing them with simpler, perception-aligned visual forms would significantly improve interpretability.
